<div class="post">
    <p>I've been fairly silent over the past few weeks. Some of that has been personal time and some for work. Working on something that I hope will be helpful to those of us who are at a loss about the issue of sexual harassment in the tech community. What can we really do and where do we start?</p>

<p><a href="http://pauladamsmith.com/">Paul Smith</a> contacted me shortly after my post with an idea his wife, Michelle, had. Why don't we create a pledge where people from the Django community can state that they will no longer attend conferences and events without a code of conduct in place? A simple form where members of the community can sign and pledge their support?</p>

<p>So, I formed a team and we got to working on what is now: <a href="http://letsgetlouder.com/">http://letsgetlouder.com/</a></p>

<p>It is a start and I am hoping that it gives a voice to those who want to see things change. Let's get loud and let the world know that the Django community does not agree with this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to say thank you. Thanks to all of you who have been supportive over the past few weeks. It has been overwhelming and humbling. I am proud to say that I am a member of the Django community, not only for the technology aspect, but for the people too.</p>
