<p>Hello! I am Julia Elman -- a Lead UI Developer based in Durham, North Carolina. I lead design and development projects, and coach people to help them reach their full potential and create amazing things. My most recent work includes the <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from technology, I like spending time hiking and camping in the woods of North Carolina and spending time with my family.</p>

<p>Want to work together? <a href="mailto:hello@juliaelman.com">Iâ€™d love to hear from you</a>.</p>
